Sort-Fire-Starters


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.


It changes the sort order of fire starters when building a fire.  
The original sort order is strictly by name, which would sometimes put unusable items before usable ones (e.g. "Magnifying Lens" before "Wood Matches" when there is no sunlight)

This mod will put burning items (Torch, Flare) first, then "normal" fire starters (Matches, Fire Striker), and then those needing sunlight (Magnifying Lens, [Binoculars](https://github.com/WulfMarius/Binoculars)).  
Each category will be sorted by chance to start the fire (highest chance first) and then by name.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.

Can be installed with the [Mod-Installer](https://github.com/WulfMarius/Mod-Installer).
